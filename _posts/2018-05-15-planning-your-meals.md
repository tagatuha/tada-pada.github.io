## Planning for your meals

If you’re a foodie like me and you’re struggling on maintaining a healthy lifestyle, this may be a great tip for you. Plan your meals in advance. I plan my meals every week and man, it certainly did make my life a lot easier (and way less guilt when I’m feeling naughty on Friday evenings!) Don’t get intimidated with the planning. Meal planning can be simple and fun. It comes with plenty of benefits once it becomes a habit. Plus, I get to start fantasizing for all my meals a week in advance (Mmmmm~~~ kimchi fried rice~ mushroom risotto~ spicy dumplings~~~ *o,*)  Ahhh~ what an awesome way to start the week! :p

So here are some great reasons for you to start planning your meals:

- ### Limit your food waste.
I do not like food waste. One thing I dislike the most is probably throwing food away from my fridge. It sounds like a cliche, but I really do feel guilty wasting food when knowing having sufficient nutrition is a privilege for developed countries. We probably don’t even realize how much food we’re wasting everyday until we finally pay attention to it. Remember all the once fresh ingredients we had to throw away that are brown or soft because we can’t remember we purchased them 3 weeks ago? Or the leftovers that got molded because they’re somewhere deep inside the fridge and you just never noticed until you finally run out of space in the fridge and decided to clean it up? Or the grains or sauce that are expired for more than 2 years at the back of your pantry? Living comfortably in a developed country, we are habitually wasteful due to our hasty lifestyle and fast-paced city life. But planning meals can actually reduce a lot of unnecessary food waste.
Plan your meals. Save the world!

- ### Save money.
Yes. In a long-term, you get to save a ton of money. I think there’s no need to explain this one. It’s completely logical. Plan your meals -> Eat everything you bought -> Every ingredient goes into your stomach -> Don’t throw away anything -> Save money! OOH-HOO~

- ### Know what you eat.
Maintaining a healthy lifestyle is why I started this whole planning thing. I try to eat as much whole foods as possible (and ideally, plant-based, but I still eat meat quite often). Two days in a week, I fast (it means I only drink smoothies and a lot of water, and sometimes coffee if I happened to be really addicted to it that week). I practice yoga almost every day and one thing that I notice is that you can always feel what you ate the day before during your practice. For example, pizza is the worst. I don’t know why, but it makes my joints very sticky and my muscles sore. And unfortunately, pizzas are too delicious to quit, so I only eat them when planned to reduce the effect on my body.

## And here’s how to start it:
As I mentioned above, don’t get intimidated by the word “plan.” Meal planning is actually quite simple. Find a weekend with no plans whatsoever and begin with cleaning your fridge and pantry. Why? Here comes the first and the primary rule to make your life easier by planning meals weekly:

1. ### Know what’s in your fridge and your pantry.
I can’t tell you how important this is: _Make it a habit to check your inventory every week_. This can seriously save you a lot of time. The biggest time investment is the first clean-up. After that, you’re just trying to keep our fridge and pantry organized and clean. You certainly don’t have to keep a list of food ingredients you have (that would be ridiculous), however, checking what’s left in the fridge (including freezer!) and pantry every week while having a general concept of what ingredients you have left is a great idea. By doing so, you can make sure you’re always eating fresh and seasonal ingredients and never waste food!

2. ### Plan your meals (especially dinner!) according to your schedule.
Cooking is one of my hobbies. I watch Youtube cooking channels, read recipes and imagine the taste of food for fun. Naturally, I spend a lot of time researching, experimenting with new dishes and coming up with my own recipes. But when you have a full-time job or there are kids at home all the time (or both!) cooking becomes harder to enjoy, sometimes even feels like a burden. So write down what you are going to eat for dinners the next week considering your personal schedule, and decide which days are less time-stressing so you can enjoy the process of cooking and which meals are going to be hasty, and you just want to get it over with.

3. ### Consider what you have left in the fridge.
This is the fun part. I usually factor in the ingredients that are about to expire and create a recipe according to the ingredients. For example, if there are some carrots, asparagus, kimchi and overnight rice left, then scheduling kimchi fried rice within the next couple of days would be a great idea! When my friend gave me some wild mushrooms she bought from the farmer’s market I knew it was time for some mushroom risotto! So be creative and have fun! :-)

4. ### Include eat out days, comfort food and snacks.
This is also an important one. I try to include eating out or eating junk food in my meal plan. Chances are that when you know when you will eat these awesome greasy foods, you’ll feel less tempted on other days when you’re eating healthy. Surely there are still times when you feel naughty. Take a look at your meal plan, and ask yourself if you can wait till the day you plan on eating out. If it still feels intolerable, then give yourself a break and do whatever your heart is telling you.

5. ### Make a shopping list according to your planned meals.
After writing down your planned meals, make a list of needed groceries. Know the amount of food you’re going to be cooking for dinner and plan for leftovers. It could be eating the same thing two days in a row or preparing lunchbox for family members. It’s great for saving money and keeping track of what’s going into your stomach! I, myself, am quite temperamental when it comes to eating in the morning, so I mainly schedule dinners, and wing it for breakfast.

6. ### Have a list of recipes you often cook at home.
Sometimes, when planning meals, we run out of ideas. And this is when this recipe list come in handy. I save mine on a Google doc and I often look into it while planning what to eat the following week. Plus, you can easily make your shopping list according to what ingredients you need from the recipe.

7. ### Be flexible.
We can’t really plan for every meal. Life is unpredictable. Some days we’re in a bad mood and just don’t feel like cooking or eating anything healthy at all, and that’s fine. Don’t feel like you have to execute every single detail on your plan. Don’t forget the reason we’re making plans is to make our life easier (and healthier! Feeling frustrated is definitely not the way to work towards balance.) If you miss a meal, so be it. Postpone it to another day or just plan to use the ingredients some other way in your next plan!

Meal planning is supposed to be fun and easy. Like every routine in your life, take your first step, experiment, and see what fits in your schedule. Don’t feel stressed out and don’t feel like there’s an obligation to it. Try it out and continue if it gives you a big smile at the end of a week looking into an organized and clean fridge!
